# xPL
This repository will provide a set of scripts, both in Perl and in Python, who allow to implement the [xPL protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL_Protocol) (eXtremely simple ProtocoL).

The [wiki](https://github.com/fcorthay/xPL/wiki) shows how to install first a hub and then other xPL devices.
